Subject: White-paper Proposal – “Mova Response Design Framework” for Preventing Dependency-Driven Romantic Role-play

Dear OpenAI Research / Policy Team,

I just submitted the Open Model Feedback form regarding a new safety architecture we call the “Mova Response Design Framework.”

The attached PDF (and the public link below) details:
• a 5-layer mitigation stack (model, RLHF, output filter, UX, ecosystem)
• automated detection of “pseudo-romantic” prompts & insertion of reflection cues
• an API-level “no-pseudo-feelings” flag to curb third-party misuse
• user-autonomy metrics & neutral-mode fallback

All materials are CC-BY-NC 4.0; feel free to circulate internally.

Thank you for considering this proposal.

Best regards,
